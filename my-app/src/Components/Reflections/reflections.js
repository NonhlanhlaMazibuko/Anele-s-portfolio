          Health System sciences (HSS) is defined as the study of components that builds up health system and how health system functions. It compliments basic sciences and clinical sciences which were known as the traditional pillars of health education. It addresses that adequate healthcare service rendered is influenced by factors that support the health system. These factors include Governance, Finance, Service Delivery, Human Resources, Health Information Systems, and Medicines and Technologies. Therefore, HSS is regarded as the third pillar of health education that must not be underestimated 
            However, health system sciences can also be defined as the course or discipline that integrates Health System Sciences, Public Health and Bioethics and Health law. Public Health focuses on the health of the population and how health systems can intervene to meet with the needs of diverse population groups. Bioethics and Health law. focuses on ethics within health science and how laws protect human rights. Health system sciences aims to improve patient experience in healthcare, promoting or enhancing population health and reducing the cost of healthcare so that it can be accessible to everyone. Within those aims it includes system thinking to understand the interconnection of components of health system, linking core content, cross-cutting and complementary content. Core content are building blocks of health system., and cross-cutting content includes leadership and teaming while complementary content includes history, ethics and legal context. In summary, it helps us to understand how healthcare professions work within the system and how healthcare service rendered be improved

          I was aware that there are various systems that influence health care service rendered in our communities but my understanding on those systems was limited. For example, governance plays an important role in decision-making in the health system. In the process decision making system thinking must be central to consider various factors that must be considered such as finance, human resources and others. 
            As someone who was once exposed to the environmental and health field, I was aware of public health, bioethics and health law. In health, there are work ethics and laws that must be obeyed to protect human rights. For example, before conducting experiment involving human, you must submit an application to human research ethics committee before proceeding with the experiment. My reflection of public health, it plays a vital role in addressing the health risk that may affect the population. My reflection when I was in environmental sciences, we used to visit villages in Bushbuckridge to address issues that may affect their health when the environment is not conserved. During those visits, we used to conduct qualitative and semi-quantitative questionnaires about their socio-economic status. I noted there is low -income source as a result some households use fuelwood as their source of energy since they do not afford to buy electricity. Despite of health concern that may results from burning fuelwoods (such as respiratory problems), they do not have another alternative. In relation to my story to the content we are though in HSS, in public health, we need to look for the source that may affect they population not just looking only on the health concern but the sources of health problems. For example, the increase of HIV and AIDS in teenagers may be influenced by what and how that problem can be solved. This requires system thinking.

            Health is defined as the state of complete physical, mental and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity. It is a fundamental human right” (WHO, 1946). This definition by World Health Organization (1946) defined health in a holistic manner including physical, mental and social dimensions. Physical dimension focusses on functioning of body parts, mental dimension focuses consciousness of the individual and social dimension focuses on ability to interact socially. However there any studies that opposed this definition claiming it is idealistic and outdated. They claim health cannot be absolute and that definition was created when communicable diseases were the main health burden, but today, chronic diseases are more prevalent. Other argument was that it is less considerate of chronic disease. These claims resulted to alternative proposed definitions. 
            Bircher's Definition (2005): Health is a dynamic state of well-being characterized by physical, mental, and social potential, which can meet the demands of life based on one's age, culture, and responsibilities. Huber et al. (2011): Health is the ability to adapt and self-manage in the face of physical, mental, and social challenges, highlighting resilience and coping mechanisms rather than the absence of disease.
            Other studies proposed that health is a dynamic process that can be understood differently depending on social, cultural, and historical context.

            Reflection
            After this lesson, I noted that I was defining health wrong. I thought it focus only with hospitals, health professionals and patients excluding socially. I support the objections raised by other studies on WHO (1946) health definition. My support is based on less consideration of chronic diseases, people who are living with chronic disease can live healthy live despite of the condition. My support is also stated by Leonardi (2018) that based on WHO (1946) definition people who have chronic disease may never be regarded as health even if they have healthy lifestyle.

          Mokgobi’s (2014) study on traditional African healing explores its history and how it is often misinterpreted or misunderstood in relation to religion in modern society. Traditional African healing is an ancient practice used to address illnesses and spiritual issues through herbal medicine and rituals. This indigenous practice is guided by ancestral knowledge passed down through generations. There are various types of traditional healers with different specializations, including diviners, Sanusi, traditional surgeons, and traditional birth attendants. In African belief, ancestors mediate between individuals and God, which contrasts with Western religious views that see deliverance as coming directly from God. Traditional African healing encompasses physical, spiritual, biological, ecological, and psychosocial domains. However, the WHO (1946) definition of health did not account for spirituality in its definition.

            After reviewing this paper, I realized there is a common misunderstanding of traditional African healing and its relation to religion. In modern society, practices such as using traditional herbs are often mistakenly associated with traditional African religion. For instance, using herbs like the licorice plant (imphepho in IsiXhosa) for ailments like colds or fevers is sometimes misinterpreted as a religious act, though it is typically not used for spiritual purposes but rather for its medicinal benefits.
            Additionally, in reviewing the WHO’s (1946) definition of health, I observed that it does not consider the impact of spirituality on individual well-being. For me, spirituality involves guidance on understanding the meaning of life, which I receive from my ancestors—deceased family members who I believe gained their wisdom from God. When I feel disconnected from God and my ancestors, I experience mental and social exclusion. The WHO's 1946 definition, which omits spirituality, makes me feel excluded from being truly healthy. The lack of consideration for African spirituality in this definition may reflect cultural biases, as different societies have varying perceptions of health and spirituality. Recent attempts to redefine health acknowledge that spirituality plays a crucial role in well-being (Perrin and McDermott, 1997; VanderWeele et al., 2017). In healthcare, spirituality has been shown to significantly influence physical and mental outcomes for patients (de Brito Sena et al., 2021). According to Ferreira-Valente et al. (2020), spirituality helps patients cope with their conditions.

          Medical pluralism refers to the coexistence of multiple medical systems to assist in health conditions simultaneously. The availability of different health systems enables people to choose which one they want to seek consultation from. The health sector patients decide to use is due to individuals’ personal beliefs, values, and explanatory models to treat an illness. Kleinman (1980) developed a model that demonstrates the intersection of this system into three sectors: Popular, professional, and Folk. 
            The popular sector is the largest health sector, where healing begins within our local communities. It includes home remedies, diet, and internet searches for medication. It’s also known as self-treatment sector in which an individual self-prescribed medicine works without consultation with a medical or traditional practitioner. It is related to healing that provides care.
  
                                            
            Professional Sector: This sector includes formal healthcare provided by trained practitioners in biomedicine, modern scientific medicine, or Western medicine. It is mainly funded or supported by the government. Healing in this sector focuses on solving specific problems. The professional health sector is based on the positivist approach, which relies on understanding what exists (ontology) and how we know and understand these things (epistemology). In short, the positivist approach prioritizes evidence and objective observation.
  
                        

            The folk sector: it is unprofessional sector that has specialist care which involves complementary and alternative medicine. It includes homeopathy, herbalism and traditional medicine. It is related to healing the form of providing restoration

            There are different forms of health systems from which people tend to seek help. I agree with the explanation that the choice of health that each individual tends to choose depends on his beliefs, values, and explanation of the illness. I mostly use the popular sector, creating my remedies for cough, headache, and wound healing like cannabis leaves, aloe, and licorice plant tea (see pictures under popular sector). This choice of medication I attained from social media through recommendations from my grandparents and through a belief in traditional herbs. I used indigenous herbs due to their accessibility and affordability in my community in the Eastern Cape. After using them but with no improvement or healing, I tend to seek professional assistance from the medical doctors and folk sector from traditional doctors (sangoma), I combine professional, popular, and folk health sectors to optimize healing processes. This form of collaboration between these two sectors is stipulated in the Moshabela et al. (2017) study. Moshabela et al. (2017) further explained that the gap between these sectors caused delays in finding solutions to health issues. The recommendation to collaborate with these sectors to accelerate drug discovery has either not been implemented or is progressing slowly. Tugendhaft's (2010) dissertation stipulated the barriers to collaboration between these sectors. The stigma of the superiority of the professional or biomedicine sector over other health sectors is a barrier. This stigmatization is influenced by grounds of scientific evidence that biomedicine demonstrates, whereas the folk sector (e.g., traditional healing) is influenced by spirituality (Campbell et al., 2010). This relates to last week's course content on defining health. The social domain has a significant role in our well-being. The professional sector is heavily influenced by Western culture in which they have different perceptions of health as positivism.  
            On the other hand, the folk sector (e.g., African tradition) is influenced culturally or spiritually through communication with ancestors. Therefore, in contrast to these sectors (profession and folk), the gap is influenced by differences in belief systems between these societies. This claim aligns with Campbell et al.'s (2010) study, which suggests that the challenge in connecting these sectors is caused by different explanatory models of illness that shape the foundation of each health sector. For example, traditional practitioners will interpret mental illness with an imbalance of spirituality using indigenous explanatory models such as upsets of ancestors due to rituals that had failed or by witchcraft (Campbell et al., 2010). In professional sectors (biomedicine), mental illness is analyzed using the hegemonic explanatory model of illness, which relies on scientific treatment intervention within Western culture (Campbell et al., 2010).

          Unpacking the role of public health and reflection
Public health involves efforts to improve the health of entire communities by addressing common health problems and finding ways to prevent them. It focuses on groups or communities rather than individual patients. Public health examines community living conditions and analyzes potential health problems to promote early prevention. For example, it includes assessing environmental factors such as clean water, proper sanitation, and air quality. By evaluating these factors, we can determine the risk of issues like waterborne diseases from unsafe or contaminated water and respiratory diseases from poor air quality. Based on these assessments, public health efforts should include community education about potential hazards and the implementation of preventive measures.
Effective public health interventions require good governance, adequate resources, advocacy, and information. After implementing interventions, it is essential to evaluate their effectiveness.
In 2022, I got an opportunity to conduct a survey with Wits environmental science students to assess the living conditions in Masingita Village, Mpumalanga. The survey results in analyses about Masingita village show that the communists are living at a high risk of being infected by waterborne and respiratory diseases. During water outages, one-third of households depended on rivers for drinking water. Additionally, nearly 50% of the community used firewood for energy, increasing their risk of respiratory issues. We conducted awareness campaigns about these health risks and suggested preventive measures, such as storing water in tanks and boiling it before drinking. We also recommended that the Wits Rural Facility expand its support to more villages. Through this experience, I want to highlight how our environment impacts our health. Although the public health concept was discussed in terms of diseases like HIV/AIDS in the course, its principles are applicable in many other contexts beyond the health department.

   
 
 
Measures of population health
Population health is measured broadly from morbidity and mortality. Morbidity is concerned with cases of impairment and disability. Mortality focuses on several infant mortality rates (IMR), Child mortality rates, and case-specific mortality. 
We measure population health by dividing the incidence cases of the disease or study concern by the number of people at risk or susceptible to that disease.  For example, when calculating the I, we divide the number of infant deaths by the number of live births times by 1000. Therefore, when there is a high infant mortality rate, there must be interventions to find the cause and solutions. Concerning the recent video from Carte Blanche (see link https://youtu.be/OoFPD2vq8dQ), there is an increase in infant mortality rate in the Eastern Cape around the OR Tambo district. Their analysis found that hunger is the cause of the rise in IMF in the district. As a result, measures were put in place to address poverty in the region with the help of food parcels from NGOs. As a resident of the OR Tambo district, I observed this devastating increase in the infant mortality rate. In 2022, I took an intervention to visit orphanage homes in the region to donate snacks and clothes, which was the least I could offer.
